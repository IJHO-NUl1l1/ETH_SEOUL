Voting System for Idol Group Debut Survival Show

## Purpose
Produce 101 was a popular Korean TV program that gathered 101 boys and girls,
with the final 11 being chosen through voting to debut as an idol group.
However, it was revealed that there was manipulation in every vote, causing significant controversy socially.
This manipulation was primarily carried out by a single producer who oversaw the production of the Produce 101 series,
highlighting the issue with an opaque and centralized system.
Consequently, many young hopefuls faced disappointment due to the system's flaws.
